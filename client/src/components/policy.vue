The United States’s is a full member of the Financial Action Task Force(FATF), the intergovernmental body whose purpose is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
Perfect Funding LT now has policies in place to deter people from laundering money.

These policies include:
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring clients have valid proof of identification</li>
        <li>Maintaining records of identification information</li>
        <li>Determining that clients are not known or suspected terrorist by checking their names against list of known or suspected terrorist.</li>
        <li>Informing clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity</li>
        <li>Closely following clients’ money transactions</li>
        <li>Not accepting cash, money orders or third party transactions</li>
        <li>Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources.</li>
      </ul>
Money Laundering Usually follows three stages:
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system.</li>
        <li>Secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts, through a series of financial transactions designed to obscure the origin of the money.</li>
        <li>And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account).</li>
      </ul>
Mining accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, a mining account can be used to execute financial transactions that help obscure the origins of the funds.
Perfect Funding LT direct funds withdrawal back to the original source of remittance, as a preventive measure.
International Anti-money Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of potential money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance program to deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity.
These guidelines have been implemented to protect Perfect Funding LT and its clients.
